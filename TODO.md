# TODO

- [x] Add updating mini map so remote positions and map elements reflect real-time changes.
- [x] Fix remote ship movement updates to prevent warping and ensure smooth synchronization across clients.

- [x] Reduce top/bottom boundaries so ships stay visible and cannot fly off-screen.
- [ ] Build additional config ship types.
- [ ] Fine-tune power-up drop rates and timing for better pacing.
- [ ] Reduce power-up spawning rate.
- [ ] Add full energy power-up.
- [x] Add tooling to inject specific power-up types (e.g., 250 weapon drops) for test scenarios.
- [x] Fine-tune bullet energy cost so even maxed ships expend meaningful energy per shot.
- [x] Fine-tune bullet damage.
- [x] Add mines.
- [x] Fix walls.
- [x] Make wall drops 90 degrees.
- [x] Add a warp to safe zone option (F7) requiring full energy.
- [x] Add warp beacon device (Shift+1 deploy, 1 recall) with 180s timer, local timer display, and minimap indicator.
- [ ] Anti-warp.
- [x] Investigate multiplayer bounty not increasing.
- [x] Adjust braking response.
- [x] Investigate afterburner energy consumption (Shift) and recharge interaction.
- [ ] Fix max level caps for all ship buffs/power-ups.
- [x] Lock down safe zone (no shooting, bombs, or drops inside).
- [x] Add AI players/bots for single-player and practice modes.
- [ ] Display AI ship bounty above their ship (like players).
- [x] Add AI ship names (e.g., "Bot-1", or random names, or prompt at load).
- [ ] Add team system (team colors, friendly fire rules, team-based objectives).
- [x] Change the shape of mines (visual distinction from bombs).
- [ ] Make mines recyclable (placing a new mine after max should move oldest mine to new location).
- [ ] Add more intelligent AI (better pathfinding, tactics, threat assessment).
