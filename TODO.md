# TODO

- [x] Add updating mini map so remote positions and map elements reflect real-time changes.
- [ ] Fix remote ship movement updates to prevent warping and ensure smooth synchronization across clients.

- [ ] Reduce top/bottom boundaries so ships stay visible and cannot fly off-screen.
- [ ] Fine-tune thruster scaling vs. speed/energy so consumption is ~50% at high energy and ~12% at low.
- [ ] Build additional config ship types.
- [ ] Fine-tune power-up drop rates and timing for better pacing.
- [ ] Reduce power-up spawning rate.
- [ ] Add full energy power-up.
- [ ] Add tooling to inject specific power-up types (e.g., 250 weapon drops) for test scenarios.
- [ ] Fine-tune bullet energy cost so even maxed ships expend meaningful energy per shot.
- [ ] Fine-tune bullet damage.
- [ ] Add mines.
- [ ] Fix walls.
- [x] Make wall drops 90 degrees.
- [x] Add a warp to safe zone option (F7) requiring full energy.
- [x] Add warp beacon device (Shift+7/8) with 90s timer.
- [ ] Anti-warp.
- [ ] Investigate multiplayer bounty not increasing.
- [ ] Adjust braking response.
- [ ] Investigate afterburner energy consumption (Shift) and recharge interaction.
- [ ] Fix max level caps for all ship buffs/power-ups.
- [ ] Lock down safe zone (no shooting, bombs, or drops inside).
